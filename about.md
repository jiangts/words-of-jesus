I was inspired to do this study by a wonderful document compiled by my spiritual parents in 1977(!) titled "Life with Father".

It documents various wonderful occurrences of the Lord's amazing, timely, and sweet provision in their lives. In the center of the paper (which was typeset via typewriter) there's a handwritten note that says:

> Do not be anxious for your life as to what you shall eat or what you shall drink;
> nor for your body as to what you shall put on...
>
> But seek first His Kingdom and His righteousness; and all these things shall be added to you.

and on the other side, it explains God's name, Jehovah, or I AM:

> for "whatever you need, I AM"

and wrapped around the margins:

> Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly beyond all tat we can ask or think... (who knows what we need before we ask)... to Him be the glory... [in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen.]



It convinced me that deeply knowing and truly living the words of Jesus will lead me to know Him and experience Him to a much greater degree than I ever have to date. Hence, this study!
