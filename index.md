## Words of Jesus Devotional Study

This is a devotional study that I'm doing on the life and words of Jesus.

I'm not following a devotional book or guide for this study: just using a NASB study Bible, an NIV study Bible and their various study helps, and Vine's expository dictionary for reference. And most importantly, praying that each time I open Scripture the Spirit would open my heart to truly hear His words to me.

> 	see You,
> 	and follow You
> Lord Jesus!
